UnivHan is a Chinese character data project aimed at building a comprehensive, reliable, and easily accessible database for the Chinese character research community.

# Motivation

The project originated from exploring various sources such as Kanjidic2, Hán-Việt dictionaries, Hanja, and more. We realized that having a unified dataset would greatly benefit researchers, learners, and developers working with Chinese characters. Additionally, the project contributes to preserving and safeguarding the linguistic heritage.

# Build & Development

The project is continuously evolving, focusing on data standardization, optimized retrieval performance, and expanding Chinese character information according to modern standards.

# Support the Project
